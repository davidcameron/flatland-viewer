# flatland-viewer

Simple web-based game where you guess the number of sides of a Flatland creature.
The creature is rendered as if viewed from the side: all edges collapse into a single horizontal line that spins once per second, and only the white "fog" on distant edges hints at the true number of sides.
Enter your guess and see if you are correct.
